# LEDResistorCalculator

LED Resistor Calculator will allow you to calculate, with precision, the standard resistance for the LED you would use, also suggest the resistor Wattage it should be. The app have common led values, but you can also insert custom values.

FEATURES INCLUDE:

- Calculates standard and real value resistor
- Fully adjustable source and LED voltage and current
- Single LED, Series LEDs, Parallel LEDs modes
- Drop-down list with standard LEDs
- You can add your custom LEDs
- Suggestion for resistor’s power rating(Wattage)
- Adjustable resistor tolerance of 5%(E24)
- Insufficient voltage alert
- Invalid Input alert
- Dark theme for night mode use

Thanks.
