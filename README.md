# LEDResistorCalculator

This is the app that drive me to this world of Mobile development. 
I use an app from google play store 'LED Resistor calculator' and find this help for my work with LED's with resistor. Also at that time I were learning python.
With the help of kivy framework, I write my first basic calculator with python. This was very interesting but there was no flexibility, following the kivy documentation was hard.
Apk build process was so much hard.

Then I start to use android studio and It is my first app building from scratch. Though I cloned the 'LED Resistor calculator' app. [Not reverse engineering] in the version 1.0. I want to upgrade some feature in the next version. such as some other language support. more functionality, history, UI upgrade.

Now this app’s present features:

LED Resistor Calculator will allow you to calculate, with precision, the standard resistance for the LED you would use, also suggest the resistor Wattage it should be. The app have common led values, but you can also insert custom values.

FEATURES INCLUDE:

- Calculates standard and real value resistor
- Fully adjustable source and LED voltage and current
- Single LED, Series LEDs, Parallel LEDs modes
- Drop-down list with standard LEDs
- You can add your custom LEDs
- Suggestion for resistor’s power rating(Wattage)
- Adjustable resistor tolerance of 5%(E24)
- Insufficient voltage alert
- Invalid Input alert
- Dark theme for night mode use

Thanks.
